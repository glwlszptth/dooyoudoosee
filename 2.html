<p>I’m a set designer and prop stylist,<br>
working in London. My study began in fine arts.<br>
I worked in film and advertising for several years<br>
before moving into my chosen field.For someone who<br>
loves art and objects — from the most magnificent<br>
to the seemingly mundane — it was an effortless<br>
evolution.</p>
<p>Connections. I look for them everywhere. In architecture,<br>
furniture, design, food, fabric, fauna, geometry,<br>
photography and travel. I find elements that work together<br>
— or clash magnificently — and fuse them into a wholly<br>
original vision. I’m here to help you turn your brief<br>
into something brilliant.<p/>
